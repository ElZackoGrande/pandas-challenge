Here is my summary.

SUMMARY OF ANALYSIS
The analysis is performed by combining 2 datasets, one with data on schools and one with data on students. We begin by building tables (dataframes) that give us a quick way to look at various metrics, at a total level for all schools, and broken down by school. We look at math and reading scores, budgets, student counts, type of school, and calculate passing% for math, reading, and then further calculate a combined score and passing rate. We look at the highest and lowest performing 5 schools by overall passing and at scored by grade, by school size, and by school type.

CONCLUSIONS
1)If you take a look at the tables that were produced for the top 5 and bottom 5 schools, the top 5 performing schools were all charter schools and the bottom 5 performing schools were all district schools. This is despite the per student budget generally being higher for the bottom 5 schools than the top 5 schools. Looking at the scores by school type table summarizes it in a small, easy to digest table - charter school students seem to greatly outperform district school students. 

2)Looking across all of the schools, there is not an evident change in reading and math scores from 9th grade into the following grades. Also, math scores seem to generally be lower than reading scores across schools and grades. We can also see that scores and passing percentages are generally higher for Small and Medium schools versus Large schools, regardless of school type. Taken all together it seems to suggest that smaller school sizes tend to be more important than budgets in producing higher passing rates

Roll Tide!
